Algorithms and data structures are fundamental in computer science. Data structures are used to model reality and the choice of data structures affects the efficiency of algorithms. One aim with this course is to give the students knowledge of advanced data structures for some of the abstract models included in previous courses and also of a number of data structures used to represent further models, such as graphs. Another aim is to give improved knowledge of algorithms, particularily graph algorithms. The course will also give the students knowledge of techniques for analysing algorithms with resspect to performance.
